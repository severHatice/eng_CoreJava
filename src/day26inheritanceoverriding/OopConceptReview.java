	/*
	 	OOP Concept has 4 main rules in Java
	 	
	 	1)Encapsulation:
	 		a)Data hiding
	 		b)By using "private" access modifier, we can hide data
	 		c)After hiding if you want to read data from other classes, create "getters"
	 		d)After hiding if you want to update data from other classes, create "setters"
	 		e)To create objects from classes in Java we have many ways;
	 			i)A obj1 = new A(); ==> Fixed object
	 			
	 			ii)A obj2 = new A("Veli Han", 13);
	 			   A obj3 = new A("Ayse Tan", 23);
	 			   
	 			iii)A obj4 = new A();
	 				obj4.setName("Ayse Tan");
	 				obj4.setAge(43);
	 				.
	 				.
	 				.
	 				obj4.setName("Mark Stone");
	 				obj4.setAge(23);
	 				.
	 				.
	 				.
	 	 	
	 	2)Polymorphism: Overloading + Overriding 
	 		a)Overloading:....
	 		
	 		
	 		
	 		
	 		b)Overriding:....
	 		
	 		
	 		
	 		
	 		c)What is the difference between "Overloading" and "Overriding"?
	 		
	 			i)Overloading does not need "inheritance", but inheritance is must for "Overriding".
	 			ii)private and static methods can be overloaded but private and static methods cannot be overridden
	 			iii)final methods can be overloaded, but final methods cannot be overridden.
	 			iv)Overloading happens in Compile Time, but Overriding happens in Run Time 
	 			v)Overloading is faster than Overriding
	 	
	 	3)Inheritance:...
	 	
	 	4)Abstraction:
